## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- TypeScript knowledge
- Discord Developer Account
- Supabase account

### Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Someone.git
cd Someone

# Set up Discord bot
cd Someone-Discord
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Configure your Discord bot token and Supabase credentials

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Creating Your First Bridge
```typescript
import { SomeoneClient } from '@someone/sdk';

const client = new SomeoneClient({
  apiKey: process.env.SOMEONE_API_KEY,
  environment: 'production'
});

// Create a Discord-Slack bridge
const bridge = await client.bridges.create({
  name: 'My Team Bridge',
  platforms: [
    {
      type: 'discord',
      channelId: '123456789012345678',
      credentials: { botToken: process.env.DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN }
    },
    {
      type: 'slack',
      channelId: 'C1234567890',
      credentials: { botToken: process.env.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN }
    }
  ]
});
```

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Universal Message Format
```typescript
interface UniversalMessage {
  id: string;
  bridgeId: string;
  platform: 'discord' | 'slack' | 'teams' | 'telegram';
  content: string;
  attachments: UniversalAttachment[];
  reactions: UniversalReaction[];
  timestamp: Date;
  metadata: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

### Platform Connector Interface
```typescript
interface PlatformConnector {
  readonly platform: PlatformType;
  readonly capabilities: ConnectorCapabilities;
  
  authenticate(credentials: PlatformCredentials): Promise<AuthResult>;
  sendMessage(message: UniversalMessage, targetChannel: string): Promise<void>;
  onMessage(callback: (message: UniversalMessage) => void): void;
  
  // Health and monitoring
  getHealth(): Promise<HealthStatus>;
  getMetrics(): Promise<ConnectorMetrics>;
}
```
